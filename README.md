# azure-resume-cicd

This project demonstrates a fully automated cloud-native deployment.
Architecture:
-Frontend: HTML/CSS hosted on Azure Static Web Apps.
-CI/CD: GitHub Actions trigger on every push to 'main'.
-Monitoring: Azure Application Insights track visitor telemetry.
-Identity: Managed via GitHub-Azure Service Principal integration.

Every time I update the code in this repo, GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys the changes to the live Azure environment within seconds.
